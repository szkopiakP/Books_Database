Jen Weinstein and Lauren Parker rule the town of Salcombe, Fire Island every summer. They hold sway on the

and Jason, have summered together on the island since childhood, despite lifelong grudges and numerous secrets.

husband. But even with plenty to gossip about, this season starts out as quietly as any other. Until a body is
discovered, face down, off the side of the boardwalk. Stylish, subversive, and darkly comedic, this is a story
of what`s lurking under the surface of picture-perfect lives in a place where everyone has something to hide."
"059323006X","How to Know a Person","The Art of Seeing Others Deeply and Being Deeply Seen","Nonfiction","David Brooks","Random House","$19.90","2023-10-24","As David Brooks observes, “There is one skill that lies at the heart of any healthy person, family, school, community
organization, or society: the ability to see someone else deeply and make them feel seen—to accurately know another
person, to let them feel valued, heard, and understood.” And yet we humans don’t do this well. All around us are people
who feel invisible, unseen, misunderstood. In How to Know a Person, Brooks sets out to help us do better, posing questions
that are essential for all of us: If you want to know a person, what kind of attention should you cast on them? What kind
of conversations should you have? What parts of a person’s story should you pay attention to? Driven by his trademark sense
of curiosity and his determination to grow as a person, Brooks draws from the fields of psychology and neuroscience and
from the worlds of theater, philosophy, history, and education to present a welcoming, hopeful, integrated approach to
human connection. How to Know a Person helps readers become more understanding and considerate toward others, and to find
the joy that comes from being seen. Along the way it offers a possible remedy for a society that is riven by fragmentation,
hostility, and misperception. The act of seeing another person, Brooks argues, is profoundly creative: How can we look
somebody in the eye and see something large in them, and in turn, see something larger in ourselves? How to Know a Person
is for anyone searching for connection, and yearning to be understood."
"0593653149","Hidden Potential","The Science of Achieving Greater Things","Nonfiction","Adam Grant","Viking","$21.00","2023-10-24","We live in a world that’s obsessed with talent. We celebrate gifted students in school, natural athletes in sports,
and child prodigies in music. But admiring people who start out with innate advantages leads us to overlook the
distance we ourselves can travel. We underestimate the range of skills that we can learn and how good we can become.
We can all improve at improving. And when opportunity doesn’t knock, there are ways to build a door. Hidden Potential
offers a new framework for raising aspirations and exceeding expectations. Adam Grant weaves together groundbreaking
evidence, surprising insights, and vivid storytelling that takes us from the classroom to the boardroom, the playground
to the Olympics, and underground to outer space. He shows that progress depends less on how hard you work than how well
you learn. Growth is not about the genius you possess—it’s about the character you develop. Grant explores how to build
the character skills and motivational structures to realize our own potential, and how to design systems that create
opportunities for those who have been underrated and overlooked. Many writers have chronicled the habits of superstars
who accomplish great things. This book reveals how anyone can rise to achieve greater things. The true measure of your
potential is not the height of the peak you’ve reached, but how far you’ve climbed to get there."
"1524761044","Tupac Shakur","The Authorized Biography","Biography","Staci Robinson","Crown","$24.50","2023-10-24","Tupac Shakur is one of the greatest and most controversial artists of all time. More than a quarter of a century
after his tragic death in 1996 at the age of just twenty-five, he continues to be one of the most misunderstood,
complicated, and influential figures in modern history. Drawing on exclusive access to Tupac’s private notebooks,
letters, and uncensored conversations with those who loved and knew him best, this estate-authorized biography
paints the fullest and most intimate picture to date of the young man who became a legend for generations to come.
In Tupac Shakur, author and screenwriter Staci Robinson—who knew Tupac from their shared circle of high school
friends in Marin City, California, and who was entrusted by his mother, Afeni Shakur, to share his story—unravels the
myths and unpacks the complexities that have shadowed Tupac’s existence. Decades in the making, this book pulls
back the curtain to reveal a powerful story of a life defined by politics and art—a man driven by equal parts brilliance
and impulsiveness, steeped in the rich intellectual tradition of Black empowerment, and unafraid to utter raw truths
about race in America. It is a story of a mother and son bound together by a love for each other and for their people,
and the relationship that endured through their darkest times. It is a political story that begins in the whirlwind of the
1960s civil rights movement and unfolds through a young artist’s awakening to rage and purpose in the ’90s era of
Rodney King. It is a story of dizzying success and its devastating consequences. And, of course, it is the story of
Tupac’s music, his timeless, undying message as it continues to touch and inspire us today."
"0812993209","Ours Was the Shining Future","The Story of the American Dream","History","David Leonhardt","Random House","$24.03","2023-10-24","Two decades into the twenty-first century, the stagnation of living standards has become the defining trend of
American life. Life expectancy has declined, economic inequality has soared, and, after some progress, the
Black-white wage gap is once again as large as it was in the 1950s. How did this happen in the world’s most
powerful country? And what happened to the “American dream”—the promise of a happier, healthier, more
prosperous future—which was once such an inextricable part of our national identity? Drawing on decades of
writing about the economy for The New York Times, Pulitzer Prize–winning writer David Leonhardt examines
the past century of American history, from the Great Depression to today’s Great Stagnation, in search of an
answer. To make sense of the rise and subsequent fall of the American dream, Leonhardt tells the story of the
modern American economy as an ongoing battle between two competing forms of capitalism: one that
envisions prosperity for most, and one that serves the individual and favors the wealthy. In vivid prose, Ours Was
the Shining Future traces how democratic capitalism flourished to make the American dream possible, until the
latter decades of the twentieth century when, bit by bit, the dream was corrupted to serve only the privileged few.
Ours Was the Shining Future is a sweeping narrative full of innovation and grit, human drama and hope. Featuring
the trailblazing figures who helped shape the American dream—Frances Perkins, Paul Hoffman, Cesar Chavez,
Robert Kennedy, A. Philip Randolph, Grace Hopper, and more—this engaging history reveals the power of grassroots
democratic movements from across the political spectrum. And though the American dream feels lost to us now,
Leonhardt shows how Americans—if they commit themselves to transforming the economy, as they did in the
past—have the power to revive the dream once more."
"0593444515","Prequel","An American Fight Against Fascism","History","Rachel Maddow","Crown","$21.51","2023-10-17","Inspired by her research for the hit podcast Ultra, Rachel Maddow charts the rise of a wild American 
strain of authoritarianism that has been alive on the far-right edge of our politics for the better part of
a century. Before and even after our troops had begun fighting abroad in World War II, a clandestine
network flooded the country with disinformation aimed at sapping the strength of the U.S. war effort
and persuading Americans that our natural alliance was with the Axis, not against it. It was a sophisticated
and shockingly well-funded campaign to undermine democratic institutions, promote antisemitism, and
destroy citizens’ confidence in their elected leaders, with the ultimate goal of overthrowing the U.S.
government and installing authoritarian rule. That effort worked—tongue and groove—alongside an
ultra-right paramilitary movement that stockpiled bombs and weapons and trained for mass murder
and violent insurrection. At the same time, a handful of extraordinary activists and journalists were
tracking the scheme, exposing it even as it was unfolding. In 1941 the U.S. Department of Justice finally
made a frontal attack, identifying the key plotters, finding their backers, and prosecuting dozens in federal
court. None of it went as planned. While the scheme has been remembered in history—if at all—as the
work of fringe players, in reality it involved a large number of some of the country’s most influential elected
officials. Their interference in law enforcement efforts against the plot is a dark story of the rule of law
bending and then breaking under the weight of political intimidation. That failure of the legal system had
consequences. The tentacles of that unslain beast have reached forward into our history for decades. But
the heroic efforts of the activists, journalists, prosecutors, and regular citizens who sought to expose the
insurrectionists also make for a deeply resonant, deeply relevant tale in our own disquieting times."
"0525521046","Surrender","40 Songs, One Story","Biography","Bono","Knopf","$17.78","2022-11-01","“When I started to write this book, I was hoping to draw in detail what I’d previously only sketched in songs. The
people, places, and possibilities in my life. Surrender is a word freighted with meaning for me. Growing up in
Ireland in the seventies with my fists up (musically speaking), it was not a natural concept. A word I only circled
until I gathered my thoughts for the book. I am still grappling with this most humbling of commands. In the
band, in my marriage, in myfaith, in my life as an activist. Surrender is the story of one pilgrim’s lack of progress ...
With a fair amount of fun along the way.” —Bono. As one of the music world’s most iconic artists and the cofounder
of the organizations ONE and (RED), Bono’s career has been written about extensively. But in Surrender, it’s Bono
who picks up the pen, writing for the first time about his remarkable life and those he has shared it with. In his
unique voice, Bono takes us from his early days growing up in Dublin, including the sudden loss of his mother when
he was fourteen, to U2’s unlikely journey to become one of the world’s most influential rock bands, to his more than
twenty years of activism dedicated to the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty. Writing with candor, self-reflection,
and humor, Bono opens the aperture on his life—and the family, friends, and faith that have sustained, challenged,
and shaped him. Surrender’s subtitle, 40 Songs, One Story, is a nod to the book’s forty chapters, which are each named
after a U2 song. Bono has also created forty original drawings for Surrender, which appear throughout the book."
